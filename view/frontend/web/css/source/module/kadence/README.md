# Kadence Blocks

The wordpress plugin `Kadence Blocks - Gutenberg Page Builder Toolkit`
is needed with this CSS code.
Or else disable all imported code.

This CSS is copy of the styles.css from each module found on the github page.
Found here -> https://github.com/kadencewp/kadence-blocks/tree/master/src/blocks

Pro blocks are not include.
And need to be added manually
via the same instruction as custom styles found on our wiki.

## Blocks not included

- Forms, use Formidable instead as it works headless

## Note

Most Kadence blocks have no variables and so have not customization.
We are planing to also add this at a later stage.
But for now simply override these files if needed.
