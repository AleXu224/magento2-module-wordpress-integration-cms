# Gutenberg base block styles

These styles are customized to fit the headless environment
and only have the bare minimum.

These styles are meant to stay as close as possible to the core.
So any change needs to extend instead of editing directly!

## Vendors

The theme styles also come with set of default vendors we use.
Unset theme if needed.
